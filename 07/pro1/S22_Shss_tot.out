Result of calculation of MES
# combination: one of all possible cases generated by paralogous sequences.
# MES: the minimum evolution score of a phylogenetic tree comprising the sequences of backbone_list and a combination.
# diff_MES: the difference of scores between two phylogenetic trees; one consists of the sequences of backbone_list;
the other consists of the sequences of backbone_list and a combination.
# * indicates a minimum of MES.
